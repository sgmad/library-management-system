# Library Management System

A Java Swing-based Library Management System built using `JFrame` and `JPanel`. This project emphasizes the implementation and improvement of core algorithms ‚Äî specifically **QuickSort** and **Binary Search** ‚Äî as part of the core application logic.

---

## Purpose

This system was developed as part of a project focused on algorithmic thinking and efficiency in software design. The application combines a functional user interface with optimized search and sorting algorithms to manage a collection of books.

---

## Key Features

- Graphical interface (Java Swing) for interacting with library data.
- Book borrowing and return system with dynamic updates.
- Real-time book **searching** using an optimized **Binary Search**.
- Book **sorting** by title or author using custom **QuickSort**.
- Performance improvements and enhancements over standard algorithm implementations.

---

## Algorithms Implemented

### üîç Binary Search
- Classic implementation adapted to work with sorted book data.
- Optimized for dynamic arrays and real-time user interaction.
- Evaluated against linear search for performance on larger datasets.

### ‚ö° QuickSort
- Implemented from scratch to sort book data (by title, author, etc.).
- Improved pivot selection and tail call optimization.
- Benchmarked against built-in Java sorting methods.

## How to Run

This is a standard Java application with no external dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
