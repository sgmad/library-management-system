# Library Management System with Book Borrowing

A desktop-based Library Management System implemented in Java Swing. This project demonstrates the design of a basic GUI application capable of managing books and members, with features for borrowing and returning books. The system also implements and improves search and sorting algorithms as part of its core logic.

---

## üìö Project Overview
The Library Management System allows users to:
- Add and manage library books.
- Add and manage members.
- Borrow and return books.
- Sort and search through the catalog using different algorithms.
- Compare the performance between  base and improved algorithms.

This version does not use implement a database. All data is stored in .csv files found in `/src/03final_output/sample_data` folder.

## üîß Revisions Based on Panel Feedback
The following changes were made as part of the panel‚Äôs recommendations during the project defense:

1. **Removed Compare Algorithms Button (GUI):**  
   The button for algorithm comparison was hidden from the main interface to satisfy the panel‚Äôs instruction to fully remove the ability to compare algorithms, though the code remains implemented internally.

2. **Implemented Custom Abstract Data Type (ADT):**  
   Introduced `CustomBookList`, a dedicated ADT to manage the library‚Äôs book collection, as per the panel's instruction to create an ADT favoring it over the previous incarnation's ArrayList.

3. **Improved Binary Search Algorithm:**  
   The improved search algorithm now uses a **hybrid binary-linear approach**, switching to a short-range linear search once the interval becomes small.  
   This was added to satisfy the panel‚Äôs requirement for an ‚Äúimproved‚Äù search procedure beyond cached sorting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sgmad/LibraryManagementSystem.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Run the `LibraryManagementSystem.java` file.

**Application Flow:**
1. Launch the system.
2. Login window for authentication. (User: User | Pass: 123)
3. (Optional) Add members and books to populate the list.
4. Use the Borrow feature to lend a book to a member.
5. Use the Return feature to mark a book as returned.
6. Experiment with sorting and searching functions.
7. Use the Compare Algorithms option to see performance improvements.

## üß™ Testing and Evaluation
The system was tested to ensure all major features (adding, searching, sorting, borrowing, returning) function correctly. Algorithm improvements were benchmarked using sample datasets to measure changes in execution time.

## üöÄ Possible / Future Enhancements
- Integrate SQL database for persistent storage.
- Add fine management and overdue notifications.
- Implement user authentication with roles (admin, librarian, member).
- Include barcode scanning for book identification.
